## Python
Given code was successfully run on Python 3.9.7.

## Running
To run the signal rectifier program, provide `--path path/to/file` to extract data, which was generated by `generator.py`. By default program will plot 2 graphs: original dataset and modified dataset.

Example:

```bash
python signal_rectifier.py --path data/sample.txt
```

If you'd like to plot graphs separately, set argument `--plot_original` or `--plot_clean`.
You can also output the dataset to the terminal by providing `--print_original` and/or `--print_clean`
There are 2 algorithms available for smoothing the jump areas. By default, more advanced is used. Provide `--simple` to run through simpler algorithm of smoothing.

## Testing

Once samples of datasets are generated, `jumps_test.py` can be run to test if the jump positions are identified correctly. This is vital procedure, before running `signal_rectifier.py`, because if one or more Tests do not PASS, the algorithms for smoothing wouldn't work correctly.

Usage:
```bash
python jumps_test.py data
```
